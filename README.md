Three types of data are offered:

## The story list

The list of short stories with their index numbers is stored in file [`Stories.csv`](Stories.csv).

## The code

The R code used to make the analyses is given in file `Analyses.R`. To execute it, you'll need

- An installation of the programming language [R]().
- The package `data.table`. This can be installed from within R with the command `install.packages("data.table")`

On a (Unix) command line, you can execute `Rscript Analyses.R`. This generates all the plots stored in `Plots`.

## The plots

High resolution versions of the plots are stored in the folder `Plots`, as PNG files.
